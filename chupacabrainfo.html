        <b>Chupacabras</b> can be literally translated as <em>'goat-sucker'</em>, from chupar <em>('to suck')</em> and
        cabras <em>('goats')</em>.
      </h1>

      <p class="leading-normal mb-4 text-gray-700">
        The most common description of the chupacabra is that of a reptile-like creature, said to have leathery or scaly
        greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back. It is said to be approximately 3 to 4 feet
        (0.9 to 1.2 m) high, and stands and hops in a fashion similar to that of a kangaroo.
        <br><br>
        Another common description of the chupacabra is of a strange breed of wild dog. This form is mostly hairless and
        has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. Unlike conventional
        predators, the chupacabra is said to drain all of the animal's blood (and sometimes organs) usually through
        three holes in the shape of a downwards-pointing triangle, but sometimes through only one or two holes.
        <br><br>
        <strong>History</strong>
        <br><br>
        The first reported attack eventually attributed to the creatures occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico. Eight
        sheep were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and reportedly completely drained
        of blood. A few months later, in August, an eyewitness named Madelyne Tolentino reported seeing the creature in
        the Puerto Rican town of Canóvanas, when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed. In 1975,
        similar killings in the small town of Moca were attributed to el vampiro de Moca ('the vampire of Moca').
        Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a Satanic cult; later more killings were
        reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to
        have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.
        <br><br>
        Puerto Rican comedian and entrepreneur <em>Silverio Pérez</em> is credited with coining the term chupacabras soon after
        the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other
        animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as the Dominican Republic, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,
        Colombia, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Brazil, the United States, and Mexico.
