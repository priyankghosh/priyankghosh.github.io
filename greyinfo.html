      <h1 class="my-4 font-normal"><b>Grey</b> aliens, also referred to as <b>Zeta Reticulans</b>, <b>Roswell Greys</b>,
        or <b>Grays</b>.</h1>

      <p class="leading-normal mb-4 text-gray-700">Greys are typically depicted as grey-skinned diminutive humanoid
        beings that possess reduced forms of, or completely lack, external human body parts such as noses, ears or sex
        organs. Their bodies are usually depicted as being elongated, having a small chest, and lacking in muscular
        definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are depicted as being shorter and jointed differently from
        humans with limbs proportionally different from a human.<br><br>

        <em>According to journalist C. D. B. Bryan, seventy-three percent of all reported alien encounters in the United
          States describe Grey aliens, a significantly higher proportion than other countries.</em>
        <br><br>

        <b>History</b>
        <br><br>
        During the early 1980s, Greys were linked to the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico
        in 1947. A number of publications contained statements from individuals who claimed to have seen the U.S.
        military handling a number of unusually proportioned, bald, child-sized beings. These individuals claimed,
        during and after the incident, that the beings had oversized heads and slanted eyes—but scant other
        distinguishable facial features.
        <br><br>
        In 1987, novelist <em>Whitley Strieber</em> published the book Communion, which, unlike his previous works, was
        categorized as non-fiction, and in which he describes a number of close encounters he alleges to have
        experienced with Greys and other extraterrestrial beings. The book became a New York Times bestseller, and New
        Line Cinema released a 1989 film adaption that starred Christopher Walken as Strieber
