      <h1 class="my-4 font-normal">
        In <em>ufology</em>, <b>Nordic</b> are <em>humanoid-extraterrestrials</em> purported to come from the
        <b>Pleiades</b> who resemble <b>Nordic-Scandinavians.</b>.
      </h1>

      <p class="leading-normal mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Professed contactees describe them as being six to seven feet tall (about two meters) with long blonde hair,
        blue eyes, and fair skin. Ufologist George Adamski is credited with being among the first to claim contact with
        Nordic aliens in the mid 1950s, and scholars note that the mythology of extraterrestrial visitation from beings
        with features described as Aryan often include claims of telepathy, benevolence, and physical beauty.
        <br><br>

        <em>
          - George Adamski claimed he was contacted by Nordic aliens in his books Flying Saucers Have Landed and Inside
          the Space Ships.<br><br>
          - Howard Menger claimed contact with Nordic aliens in his books, such as From Outer Space to You.<br><br>
          - Travis Walton claimed contact with Nordic aliens in his book The Walton Experience.<br><br>
        </em>

        <b>History</b>

        <br><br>
        Cultural historian <em>David J. Skal</em> wrote that early stories of Nordic-type aliens may have been partially
        inspired by the 1951 film <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em>, in which an extraterrestrial arrives on Earth to warn
        humanity about the dangers of atomic weapons. Bates College professor Stephanie Kelley-Romano described alien 
        abduction beliefs as "a living myth", and notes that, among believers, Nordic aliens "are often associated with 
        spiritual growth and love and act as protectors for the experiencers."
        <br><br>
        In contactee and ufology literature, Nordic aliens are often described as benevolent or even <em>"magical"</em>
        beings who want to observe and communicate with humans and are concerned about the Earth's environment or 
        prospects for world peace. Believers also ascribe telepathic powers to Nordic aliens, and describe them as 
        "paternal, watchful, smiling, affectionate, and youthful."
